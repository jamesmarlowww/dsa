q6 

Added the moves command to the game. It prints out possible moves and what they do

Created the gui. Didn’t want to create any card images or anything too graphical so I just printed to the gui instead. decided to keep it simple 

Should have definitely done the project with a partner… was too much work for just me. but it does work now:)
